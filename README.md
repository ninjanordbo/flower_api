# Flower API
This flower api will give you the symbolic meaning of different flowers as well as their scientific name. I have also added what color variations you can get them in.


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node and Express

This was my first attempt at building my own api with express. To use this api, you will have to do an npm install as I have not included the node modules in the repository. It uses localhost 8000.


## Lessons Learned:

I spent quite a long time failing to get this to work, but eventually relised I had forgotten to select the right content-type, hence receiving only empty objects back from my POST requests.
